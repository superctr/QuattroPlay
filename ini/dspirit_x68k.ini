; The "Ver B" music from Dragon Spirit was never used in the arcade version
; and the ROM was considered lost. But as it turns out, the music data remains
; in the X68000 port and is even in the almost exact same format!

; The only real change to the sound format is that command 0x21 is used to
; request ADPCM samples.
; They actually did a few other changes to the music in the X68K version,
; adding more panning to some songs. Unfortunately they edited the bass track
; in "Ending" to free a channel for panning the lead melody.

; You'll have to extract "DSMUSIC.DAT" from the X68K disk image, or run this
; command in the MAME debugger after loading the game:
; save DSMUSIC.DAT,294d6,10000
