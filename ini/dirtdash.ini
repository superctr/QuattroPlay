; Song 26 (Sub 46) / Jungle
; channel 0x18,0x19 plays invalid pan envelope 0xff
; making snare drum almost inaudible with stereo output
; This happens with the original sound driver and it's noticable
; in the OST too.
; The song does writes "direct" pan values just before setting the
; pan envelope. Perhaps the composer intended those values be used?
